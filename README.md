**Data Exploration**

**Dataset:**

A kaggle dataset with 7k books by Dylan Castillo (link) was used to build this semantic book recommender.

The dataset has columns such as isbn13, isbn10, title, subtitle, authors, categories, thumbnail, description, published_year, average_rating, num_pages and ratings_count

**Data Exploration Process:**
* Missing values of all the columns were analyzed using a heatmap in order to check whether there were any patterns on why such values were missing.
* Two new columns: missing_description and age_of_the book were created
- Correlation between num_pages, age_of_the book, missing_description and average rating were observed (no significant correlation)
- Books that had missing description, pages, average rating and published year were extracted (about 4% of the dataset --> removed)
- Descriptions that were not useful were removed (length between 1-24 were too short to be useful). There were 5197 books with description longer than 24 words
- Title and subtitle was merged into one column, if subtitle existed
- New column "tagged_description" was created that combined isbn13 and description (in order to make a vector database)
- Columns that we do not need such as "subtitle", "missing_description", "age_of_book", "words_in_description" were dropped.

**Data Exploration Summary:**

Since there existed no patterns between books with missing values, they were removed. Descriptions shorter than 24 words were removed. New column "tagged_description" was created and columns not in use were dropped.

**Libraries used:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy 

**Vector Search** 

**Vector Search Process** 

* Tagged description file was turned into a text file
* The text file was then loaded into TextLoader, split into chunks separated by new line character and loaded into a document file
* Then a vector database was built using Chroma and OpenAI embeddings that suggests recommendations based on query
* Then, the recommendation isbn was matched to the isbn of the original books dataframe to retrieve the title of the book that was recommended

**Packages used:** langchain-community, langchain-text-splitters, langchain-openai, langchain-chroma 

**Text Classification**

Used HuggingFace's zero-shot classifier in order to classify books with no simple_categories into one of the 4 categories.

**Text Classification Process**

* Made a simple_category column that maps top 10 categories into either fiction, nonfiction, children's fiction, children's non-fiction,
* There were 1454 books without a simple_category
* Used HuggingFace Zero-Shot Classifier to categories those books into simple categories based on their descriptions
* Tested the model with the actual fiction and non-fiction category vs. predicted category and tested the model. 77% of the predictions matched the actual categories
* Then, the model was used to predict those without a simple_category and a dataframe of predicted category and their isbns were made
* This was then merged to the existing dataframe and the predicted categories replaced simple categories with no values
* The predicted categories column was then dropped 

**Sentiment Analysis**

Used HuggingFace transformer to use the fine tuned LLM model to assign a sentiment (out of 7) to a book based on its description

* Predicting the overall emotion of the description does not return the most accurate information
* Broke the description into chunks and ran the classifier through each sentence 
* Obtained the maximum emotion probability for each description broken into chunks
* Created a dataframe with the scores of all the emotions
* Merged into the original books dataframe

**Gradio Dashboard** 

A dashboard was created for the books with an option to enter a query/ description, select a categpry, and select an emotional tone. This would generate 16 book recommendations with thumbnails (generic not found cover if no thumbnail)
